## About

botttle is a terminal emulator that draws on the GPU. Every pane runs your login
shell through a real PTY and a full ANSI emulator, and the entire window — grid,
chrome, tab strip — is rendered by [GPUI](https://gpui.rs), the same engine
behind [Zed](https://zed.dev).

It is also a workspace. Panes split right and down to any depth, tabs hold their
own layouts, and both are first-class rather than bolted on: a new pane starts in
the directory the current one is in, the focused pane is marked so you can see
where input lands, and the emulator's state — title, cursor, working directory —
is available to the app around it.

That structure is the point. Everything an agent does in a development loop —
running builds, reading logs, driving tools — already happens in a terminal, but
a terminal treats all of it as one undifferentiated stream of bytes. botttle
keeps the terminal's honesty — `ctrl-c`, `ctrl-d` and the rest reach the program
untouched — while giving the surrounding workspace the structure
that agent-driven work needs. The next step is a pane that is an agent session
rather than a shell, sharing the same tree, tab, and working directory.

**Status:** early, and moving. It is used daily by its author on macOS. Linux
should build — the platform-specific paths are there — but is untested.

## Features

**Terminal**

- Real PTYs, a full ANSI emulator ([`alacritty_terminal`](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)),
  24-bit color, text attributes, and configurable scrollback.
- Mouse selection — click, double-click for words, triple-click for lines — with
  copy, paste, and wheel scrollback.
- Window title tracking (OSC 0/2), clipboard escapes (OSC 52), and color queries.
- Block, bar, and underline cursors; a hollow cursor in unfocused panes.

**Workspace**

- Tabs, each holding its own pane layout, in a bar that scrolls horizontally once
  they fill it.
- Splits to any depth. Splitting along an axis a pane already occupies adds a
  sibling instead of nesting, so repeated splits stay flat.
- New tabs and splits open in the current pane's working directory, read from the
  PTY's foreground process group.

**Built for coding CLIs**

- **`shift-enter` is a newline**, not a send. Terminals have always sent the same
  byte for both, so botttle sends `ESC CR` — the sequence Claude Code's own
  `/terminal-setup` installs into other terminals.
- **`ctrl-v` pastes an image** by writing it to a file and typing the path, which
  is how Claude Code and Codex take images. With no image on the clipboard,
  `ctrl-v` reaches the program untouched.
- **`⌘-click` opens a URL or a path.** Holding `⌘` underlines the target first.
  Paths resolve against the pane's working directory, and a `file.rs:42:9`
  position suffix opens the file.

**Appearance**

- 12 themes — six families in light and dark — swapped live.
- A settings screen for fonts, sizes, line height, ligatures, cursor, and
  background, persisted as plain JSON.

Not there yet: IME composition, drag-to-resize splits, search, the kitty keyboard
protocol, and the agent layer itself.

## Installation

### macOS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/launchdoor-studio/botttle
cd botttle
scripts/bundle-macos.sh --install
```

This builds a release `botttle.app`, gives it the icon, signs it with the best
identity in your keychain, and copies it to `/Applications`. Because the bundle
identifier and signing identity are stable, permissions you grant it survive a
rebuild.

Signing prefers a Developer ID Application certificate, then an Apple Development
certificate, then an ad-hoc signature — all three run on the machine that built
them. Pass `--sign "<identity>"` to choose one, or `--no-sign` to skip it.

To hand the app to someone else, Gatekeeper wants it notarized:

```bash
scripts/bundle-macos.sh --notarize --install
```

That submits the signed zip through [`asc`](https://github.com/rorkai/asc) using
the App Store Connect key already in your keychain, staples the ticket, and
prints the Gatekeeper verdict. The Developer ID Application certificate itself
has to be created once by hand at
<https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/add> — the App Store
Connect API refuses it with *"This operation can only be performed by the Account
Holder."*

### From source

```bash
cargo run --release
```

Needs a recent stable Rust toolchain. On Linux, GPUI also needs the usual Wayland
or X11 development packages.

## Keybindings

`⌘` on macOS; `ctrl+shift` elsewhere.

| Chord | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `⌘T` | New tab |
| `⌘W` | Close pane — closes the tab with the last pane |
| `⌘⇧W` | Close tab |
| `⌘D` / `⌘⇧D` | Split right / split down |
| `⌘]` / `⌘[` | Focus next / previous pane |
| `⌘⇧]` / `⌘⇧[` | Next / previous tab |
| `ctrl-tab` / `ctrl-⇧-tab` | Next / previous tab |
| `⌘C` / `⌘V` | Copy selection / paste — an image if the clipboard holds one |
| `ctrl-V` | Paste a clipboard image as a file path |
| `shift-enter` | Newline instead of send |
| `⌘-click` | Open the URL or path under the pointer |
| `⌘K` | Clear |
| `⌘=` / `⌘-` / `⌘0` | Font size |
| `⌘,` | Settings — `esc` closes |

Apart from `ctrl-tab`, every other key reaches the program untouched — `ctrl-c`,
`ctrl-d`, `ctrl-z` and friends included.

## Configuration

`⌘,` opens the settings screen; every change is written straight to
`~/.config/botttle/settings.json`. The file is plain JSON and can be edited by
hand — unknown and missing keys fall back to defaults.

| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `theme` | string | `"Botttle Dark"` | Any name from [Themes](#themes) |
| `terminal_font_family` | string \| null | `null` | `null` picks the best monospace font installed |
| `terminal_font_size` | number | `13.0` | 6–40 |
| `line_height` | number | `1.4` | Multiple of the font size, 1.0–2.5 |
| `ligatures` | bool | `true` | Programming ligatures, where the font has them |
| `ui_font_family` | string \| null | `null` | Tabs, status bar, settings |
| `ui_font_size` | number | `12.0` | 8–24 |
| `background` | string \| null | `null` | `"#rrggbb"` override for the window and terminal grounds |
| `cursor_shape` | `"block"` \| `"bar"` \| `"underline"` | `"block"` | |
| `scrollback_lines` | number | `10000` | Applies to panes opened afterwards |
| `paste_images` | bool | `true` | `ctrl-v` writes a clipboard image to a file |
| `shift_enter_newline` | bool | `true` | Send `ESC CR` for `shift-enter` |

## Themes

Botttle, Gruvbox, One, Cursor, OpenCode, and VS Code, each in a light and a dark
variant — `"Gruvbox Dark"`, `"One Light"`, and so on. Gruvbox, One, and VS Code
use those projects' published terminal palettes; Cursor and OpenCode are
approximations matched by eye.

A background override replaces the window and terminal grounds while leaving the
chrome on the theme's own surfaces, so the tab strip stays readable.

## Architecture

The grid is drawn as one styled text element per row, with per-cell colors and
attributes applied as text highlights, which keeps the terminal inside GPUI's
normal layout and paint path rather than beside it. Emulation runs on its own
thread — `alacritty_terminal` owns the PTY and the parser — and reaches the UI
thread over a channel, so a program flooding stdout can't stall the window.

## Development

```bash
cargo run                      # debug build
cargo test                     # unit tests, plus an end-to-end pty test
cargo clippy --all-targets
scripts/bundle-macos.sh --debug   # a .app around the debug binary
```

The test suite covers key encoding, link detection, theme resolution, settings
round-trips, and working-directory lookup, and includes an end-to-end check that
a real shell's output reaches the grid we render from.
